# Python Bot Examples (Work in progress)
Here are some examples made for demo purposes to show how you can create a discord bot in python using the libary py-cord. These examples can be used to have a basic ground to start coding/get an Idea how a specific feature of a bot could be working.

**Disclaimer:** These examples are only a demonstration and could be made different. ItÂ´s just an example. You are responsible for any actions done by your own bot.
I am not responsible for any damage taken on your system/cloud hosting if anything goes wrong etc...
